# Ahk-For-accordion-In-Atlas
A list of created AHK files with songs converted to play on accordion in Atlas.
Must have Autohotkey to use EXE files.
Use ahk files to directly create a new autohotkey.exe File.
Use Text files to modify or create ahk files to convert to Autohotkey.exe
The macro creation tool can be found Here>>>>><<<<<<
Not All Music was Compiled by me. Some songs were compiled by other users in the playatlas group.
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE ORIGINAL TITLES COVERED BY THIS DATA.
To Run A Script Either open the AHK.exe file of your choosing with Atlas running and press the Hotkey assigned to start the song while your accordion is in practice mode. (right click with accordion equiped)...
Second Option Compile a new version/Modified Version by Editing your text or Ahk file. Then use the Autohotkey compiler tool to make your executable program. Make sure to pay attention to the Hotkey assignment In the text.
